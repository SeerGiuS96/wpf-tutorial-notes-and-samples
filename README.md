About WPF
What is WPF?

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is Microsoft's latest GUI framework, designed for use with the .NET framework.

GUI Framework Explained

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows you to build applications with various GUI elements such as labels and textboxes. Unlike manual creation, where you'd need to draw these elements and handle user interactions like text and mouse input, a GUI framework streamlines this process. This enables developers to focus on crafting exceptional applications.

Options for .NET Developers

For .NET developers, two primary GUI frameworks are relevant: WinForms and WPF. While WPF is newer, Microsoft continues to maintain and support WinForms. In the upcoming chapter, we'll delve into the differences between these frameworks, despite their shared goal of simplifying the creation of applications with impressive GUIs.
